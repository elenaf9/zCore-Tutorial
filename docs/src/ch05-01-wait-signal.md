# Waiting for signals from kernel objects

## Introduction to Signaling and Waiting Mechanisms

## Adding signals to kernel objects

> Define Signal structs
>
> Add signal and callbacks variables to KObjectBase, implement signal family of functions, and do unit tests

## Implement signal wait Future

> Implement the wait_signal function and do unit tests

## Use select combinator to implement multi-object wait

> implement wait_signal_many function and do unit tests
